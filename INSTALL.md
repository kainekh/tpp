To install TPP, the following steps are required:

1). Go to the **ncurses-ruby-1.3.1** directory.
2). Type **gem install ncursesw**. This will install ncursesw.
3). Go to the $TPP/tpp directory.
4). Type **sudo make install**.
	If you do not have sudo privileges, you can install it into any custom directory by editing the Makefile
5). If you want large fonts, type **sudo pacman -S figlet** on Arch-based distros and **sudo apt install figlet** on Debian-based distros.

Enjoy :)
